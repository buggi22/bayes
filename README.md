# bayes

Compute probabilities using Bayesian networks.

This is intended to be a "toy" implementation for educational purposes.  The code is not designed for efficiency and is particularly susceptible to numerical rounding errors.

## Unit tests

Unit test can be found under the [`test`](/test/com/example/ai/bayes) directory.

In particular, examples corresponding to a handful of probability exercises can be found in [`ExampleTest.java`](/test/com/example/ai/bayes/ExampleTest.java).

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:
- JUnit 3
- Google Guava
- Google AutoValue

Google AutoValue, in particular, requires annotation processing to be enabled during compilation.
