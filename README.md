# bayes

Compute probabilities using Bayesian networks.

This is intended to be a "toy" implementation for educational purposes.  The code is not designed for efficiency and is particularly susceptible to numerical rounding errors.

## Unit tests

Examples, in the form of unit tests, can be found in [`BayesNetworkTests.java`](/src/com/example/ai/bayes/BayesNetworkTest.java).

## Dependencies

This project depends on the following libraries:
- JUnit 3
- Google Guava
- Google AutoValue

Google AutoValue, in particular, requires annotation processing to be enabled during compilation.
